  A standard toast notification appears near the bottom of the screen, centered horizontally. You can change this position with the setGravity(int, int, int) method. This accepts three parameters: a Gravity constant, an x-position offset, and a y-position offset.

For example, if you decide that the toast should appear in the top-left corner, you can set the gravity like shown.

If you want to nudge the position to the right, increase the value of the second parameter. To nudge it down, increase the value of the last parameter.
